## Translations
If you wish to help translate parts of this mod, please keep in mind that most translations should probably just be copied from the original with small changes.
If you want to add translations may instead want to make them for the original first & then copy them here.

Please also keep in mind that all translations that have been changed should be made available in their original form in the built-in legacy resource pack.

## Documentation
Since the [NTM Wiki](https://nucleartech.wiki/) is only made for the original version of NTM it may be beneficial to keep a record of all things that where changed,
see [Changes from Original](./Changes.md).

If you want to make documentation for features from the original mod I would recommend contributing to the [NTM Wiki](https://nucleartech.wiki/) instead of doing work here,
if instead you wish to document code of this mod for future contributors of addon developers, you can either just write some more Markdown files here or add Javadocs to some classes.

## Code Changes
Some basic principles to follow for code changes
1. If you make any code changes, please make sure that they actually work before putting them in a Pull Request.
2. Please try to communicate your proposals for big changes before just working on them yourself,
   lots of issues can be resolved significantly quicker with a little communication!


## Footnote
Please don't shy away from correcting me as I am (as all humans are) a very stupid idiot that cannot see through all possible scenarios of how to develop something to achieve the best outcome.
If you believe that you have a better way to make something work then the way it currently works, please propose that idea, open a GitHub issue or just make a complete Pull Request.
