# NTM-Modernized
## About
NTM-Modernized is a Recreation of [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/ntm) for modern Minecraft Versions.

NTM-Modernized is a Mod all about technology, atomic science and nuclear weapons. Features include, and are not limited to:
- A large tech tree, with progression spanning over many machines and different types of reactors
- Nuclear reactors such as the Chicago Pile, the infamous RBMK and fusion reactors (and more!)
- Nuclear bombs, missiles and artillery
- Turrets, traps and other defensive systems
- Processing machines for extracting ores, assembling parts and refining oil
- Abandoned structures and dungeons to explore
- Hazards such as radiation, flammable gasses and lung diseases

For a Better Experience I recommend Installing a Recipe Viewer like [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei), [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi).
